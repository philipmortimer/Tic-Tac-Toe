This is a Java implementation of Tic Tac Toe. To view the files look at the ".java" files within the "src" folder. Open them with the text editor / IDE of your choice. To run the game, look inside the "dist" folder and execute the ".jar" file. To do this, you will need to have a version of Java installed on your computer. I have tested that everything works when using Java 17 and a Windows system. I developed the code using the NetBeans IDE. However, Intellij will also work just fine to view the source code.
