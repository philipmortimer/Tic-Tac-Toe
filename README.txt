This noughts and crosses demo was made specifically for this summer task. The demo demonsrates many of the elements
I will use in my chess game. Noughts and crosses is similar to chess, but just much less complex (and therefore
achievable for a demo). This piece features person versus person play as well as computer versus person.
There are two computers settings, one which plays random moves and one which plays the game perfectly.
